# Pinboard Popup

[Chrome extension, see the Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pinboard-popup/pfbacfpikpbgbhecjipbhdhhbpglljne)

I started using [Pinboard.in](https://pinboard.in/) and wanted to
trigger the [bookmarklet code](https://pinboard.in/howto/) with a
keyboard shortcut, however Chrome doesn't let you assign keyboard
shortcuts to simple bookmarks.

And looking at the available Chrome extensions for Pinboard I couldn't
see any official ones and I don't trust Chrome extensions from people
I don't know or pay in some capacity.

Therefore I've built my own Chrome extension. All it does is to activate
the bookmarklet for adding a website to Pinboard.

And Chrome lets you assign a keyboard shortcut to it.
Go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/),
scroll down that page and click on the *"Keyboard shortcuts"*
link. Here you can assign a shortcut for activating this extension.
I prefer *Command+D*, being also the shortcut used by the Firefox
extension.
